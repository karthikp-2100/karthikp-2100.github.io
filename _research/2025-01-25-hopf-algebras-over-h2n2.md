This project is supported by the [MIT PRIMES-USA](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/). In this project, we seek to classify the Hopf algebras over the Pansera algebras \( H_{2n^2} \). This involves first calculating the irreducible Yetter-Drinfeld modules over \( H_{2n}^2 \), then using these to calculate the associated Nichols algebras over \( H_{2n^2} \) and then finally using these to calculate the Hopf algebras over \( H_{2n^2} \) by applying the Radford lifting method. So far, we have classified some of the Yetter-Drinfel Mentored by Dr. Julia Plavnik, Dr. Hector Pena Pollastri, and Benjamin Spencer at IU-Bloomington.

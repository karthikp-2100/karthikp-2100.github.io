In Theoretical Physics, great interest has arisen in understanding generalized ”higher-form” symmetries as these can give rise to a deeper understanding of the structure of theories. We can construct certain 4d \( \mathcal{N} = 2 \) superconformal field theories (SCFTs) by compactifying 6-dimensional interacting theories with \( \mathcal{N} = (2, 0) \) on a two-dimensional Riemann surface, and this construction carries significant structure that can be used to determine global symmetries. This is called the Class S construction. For any ADE-type Lie Algebra, we can obtain such a 6d theory, and therefore obtain class S theories for these ADE-type algebras. The outer automorphisms of the centers of these theories provide even more distinct class S theories. In this paper, we describe and apply the method for computing global forms of flavor symmetry fixtures in both untwisted and twisted theories.

Four-dimensional quantum field theories with \( \mathcal{N} = 2 \) supersymmetry provide a rich theoretical laboratory to test general ideas about quantum field theory. A large class of such theories, known as Class S, arise from compactification of a six-dimensional \( \mathcal{N} = (2, 0) \) theory on a punctured Riemann surface. The \( \mathcal{N} = (2, 0) \) theories have an ADE classification, and those of type A, D, and E6 give rise to a twisted sector of the corresponding class S theories. These theories, in turn, can have interesting 2-group symmetries, which provide additional tools for understanding their physics. Right now, we are calculating 0-form symmetry groups of twisted \( A_{2N} \) theories, and will use this to calculate 2-group symmetries in twisted \( A_{2N} \) theories.

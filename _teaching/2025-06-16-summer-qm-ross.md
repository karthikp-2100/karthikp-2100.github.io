Taught an introduction to quantum mechanics for mathematically-gifted high schoolers at the 2025 Ross Mathematics Program in Ohio, emphasizing not topics covered in a traditional course such as a particle in free space, but rather emphasizing the applications of "symmetry" to quantum theory. The course started with an introduction to abstract linear algebra. Then, we covered basic quantum mechanics, including $U(1)$ actions and two-state systems. We then covered basic Lie theory, and applied this to understand the group $SU(2)$ as a double cover of $SO(3)$. Then, we classified representations of $SU(2)$, and used this to determine the angular solutions to the hydrogen atom. Finally, we discussed composite quantum systems. The class has not yet chosen the final topic, which could be either an introduction to quantum computing, an introduction to quantum field theory, solving the hydrogen atom in full, or an introduction to particle physics.

These are notes taken for Stefan Patrikis's course on the arithmetic of curves at Ross/Ohio 2025, with supplemental appendices on some commutative algebra. A course description is as follows: Local-global principles for rational points on curves. Counting points over
finite fields and the Weil conjectures for curves over finite fields. Additional
topics (some material on elliptic and modular curves) as time permits. I will
emphasize examples (plane curves, e.g.) over abstract algebraic geometry
and try to keep the prerequisites to roughly the Ross 1st-year materials and
bits of additional algebra (ring and field theory) that are outgrowths of the
first-year material. Notes can be found [here](https://karthikp-2100.github.io/files/Ross2025PatrikisDraft.pdf).

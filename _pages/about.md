I'm a high school senior at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) in Aurora, Illinois. I'm broadly interested in mathematics and physics (more specifically, subfields having to do with symmetry), but this of course is subject to change. I have three different research projects right now. The first is a project with the [MIT PRIMES-USA](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/) program under the supervision of [Dr. Julia Plavnik](https://sites.google.com/view/juliaplavnik/) at IU-Bloomington studying Hopf Algebras over the Pansera algebras \(H_{2n}^2\). The second is a project under Dr. Anderson Trimm at IMSA studying 2-group symmetries in Twisted \(A_{2N}\) Class S Theories. The third is a project under Dr. Peter Dong at IMSA doing statistics on a search for doubly-charged Higgs bosons at the LHC.

This site is meant to be a collection of my teaching, research, and academic interests, and over time I intend to add notes from classes I take (and classes I teach), research preprints, talks, book talks, blog posts, and more. Feel free to contact me via email for more information on anything on the site.
